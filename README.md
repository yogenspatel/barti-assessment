# Frontend Development Challenge (Disney Edition) 

Welcome to Barti’s frontend development challenge. For this frontend challenge you will be creating a Disney fan site that allows users to search for their favorite characters and view information about each character. You’ll be using an open api to pull data into your application. We hope you enjoy this small but fun project and have a good time showcasing your technical skills!

The coding challenge is the most important consideration for your technical assessment. You can expect to be evaluated on the following areas of your project.

- Error Handling
- Clean & Consistent Code 
- Blank States & Edge Cases
- Design implementation
- CSS/Styling 
- Proper HTML Semantics 
- Responsiveness 
- Code Comments & Readability

Once you begin the challenge, you have 24 hours to turn in your code. The challenge should likely take around 1-2 hours to complete. However, you are free to spend as much or as little time as needed to finish this assignment. 

### Tips & Recommendations
